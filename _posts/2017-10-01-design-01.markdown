Often times, we mistyped our sign up credentials in the log in form. Therefore, I want to make a design, in which we could easily switch between sign up and log in without losing the same credentials that we have filled in. <br>

And to navigate between sign up and log in, users can either swipe between pages or click the header. [See more details in Behance][behance] :D
