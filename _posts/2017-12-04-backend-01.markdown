To be able to create Maps with direction to particular destination from current location, I used [Airbnb’s react-native-maps][maps-airbnb] (for displaying maps), [React Native’s Geolocation][rn-geolocation] (to get device's current location) and [Google Directions API][google-directions] (to get routes to destination).<br>

There are a lot of ways to do this, this is just one of them. If you prefer the [step-by-step tutorial, go visit my Medium][medium-link]!
