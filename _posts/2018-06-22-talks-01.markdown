This is my summary of several talks in [Google Lightning Talks at Cannes 2018][gLightningTalk-link].

**[What does the agency of the future look like][talk11]**

- It's all about making ideas that have never been seen before

- It's hard to find competent people, one-can-do-it-all kind of people
- Partners expected more from agency, to create something with impact. One way to figure it out is by working with different verticals to get the experience right.
- Data & Storytelling: in the end, they're still people. Instead of bombarding people with the data that we have, invite and engage them to talk to us, to participate, to emphasize the campaign.

**[Build brand in the age of assistance][talk12]**
- Checkout "The Voice Playbook"
- Persona first
  - Create a persona on who is going to use the product
  - Design the voice actions that the persona are likely to use
- Prototype and Iterate Fast!
  - See if the voice action that you designed is used by the user or not
  - See if the tone voice is perfect (it has to align with the brand tone of voice)
- Focus on utility!
  - Voice activated meditation for veterans
  - Estee lauder focus on skincare and reminding about its routine rather than selling its product
- Trigger emotional responses
- Google Assistant User Journey is to be a part of:
  - User getting ready in the morning
  - User on the go
  - To help user relax in the evening
- Don't build a crappy one!

**[Can a classic tale push boundaries & set new standards][talk13]**
- Make the message clear and simple. Clear and simple message will always get through.
- Trigger emotion. Rather than spewing and bombarding user with your message, tell only enough to invite them to tell their story, to opt in your product.
- User engagement is key. When a user is engaged, there's a better chance that they would actively participate as well.

**[Customizing creative by audience][talk23]**
- To promote make up, cover girl not only target user that has interest in make up, but to all women. Because beauty has been a part of women's daily life.
- Use 6 seconds advertisement with different creatives and different copy
- One creative (new job) was found to be most impactful, and the difference in copy didn't make such a significant impact. However for a particular creative (fitness), it's found that the copy that matches the creative (I'm a gym unicorn) to be the most impactful
- Check out ["Unskippable"][unskippable]
- **How to use data?**
  Before even thinking about creative, Covergirl would dig deep into the insights that can be provided with data. Mostly would geek about:
  - Who is the target?
  - Why are they the target?
  - What's the motivation?
  - What's happening in the culture right now?
  - How to make it relevant/ What makes it relevant to the target?

**Action Item**
1. Analytics for voice assistant?
2. SEO for voice?
3. Checkout "The Voice Playbook"
4. Checkout ["Unskippable"][unskippable]
