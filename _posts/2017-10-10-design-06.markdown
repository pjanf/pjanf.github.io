This is a profile page for freelancer website.
The important information that has to be here is how many jobs that a user had done, how satisfied the previous employer were (incl. Testimonies), and of course the skillset that a user had.

A user might have a lot of skillsets and testimonies, but due to limited space in profile page, a user might want to choose which skillsets and testimonies that he or she wants to show first.
